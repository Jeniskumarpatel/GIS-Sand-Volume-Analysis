# GIS Sand Volume Analysis Project

This project was done as part of my role at Wayfinder Corp. It involves creating 3D models of sand bodies and calculating volumes using ArcGIS Pro and LiDAR data.

## Tools Used
- ArcGIS Pro
- Micromine
- Survey123 & Field Maps
- Python (ArcPy)
- LiDAR and UAV data

## Project Highlights
- Created 3D local scenes of sand pits
- Performed spatial analysis and volume calculation
- Integrated drillhole data and sampling points
- Produced high-quality maps for weekly reporting

## Files Included
- 📄 `report_summary.pdf`
- 🗺️ `volume_map.png`
- 🐍 `volume_calc_script.py`
